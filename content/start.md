title: Get started with Sistine
---

Let's build a simple static site with Sistine, from installation to deploy.

## Install Sistine

This guide will show a lot of shell commands in code blocks. Whenever you see a line beginning with a `$`, it represents a command you need to type into your shell (except the leading `$`); other lines represent output, which might not match what you see exactly, but should be close enough to guide you.

### Prerequisite: install Ink

Sistine is written in the [Ink programming language](https://dotink.co/). If you don't have Ink on your system, you'll need to [install it from a release on GitHub](https://dotink.co/docs/overview/#setup-and-installation). Sistine works on Ink releases v0.1.9 and up -- you can check the version of Ink you have by running `ink --version`.

```
$ ink --version
ink v0.1.9
```

### Get Sistine from source

Sistine currently doesn't have a simple installation method. We'll have to clone the source repository and run the program from the repository.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/thesephist/sistine
```

clone repo, symlink executable? Like Go binaries.

## Set up a project

// TODO: might require a new `init` command in Sistine

## Customize

## Deploy
